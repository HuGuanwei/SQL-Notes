    "### Aggregate opertions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Concept**: \n",
    "*Aggregation* is the act of taking multiple values and reducing them down to a single value. Two of the simplest forms of aggregation are counting and adding.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Counting \n",
    "- Adding\n",
    "- Computing the average (mean)\n",
    "- Finding the minimum (lowest value)\n",
    "- Finding the maximum (highest value)\n",

    "Aggregate expressions: combine values from multiple rows <br>\n",
    "Non-Aggregate or scalar expressions: return one value per row\n",

    "Function Name|Function Description|Example Invocation|\n",
    "-|-|-\n",
    "`COUNT`|Count all rows|`COUNT(*)`\n",
    "`SUM`|Add all supplied values and return result|`SUM(salary)`\n",

    "`MIN`|Return the lowest value|`MIN(salary)`\n",

    "Some data analysts use the expression `SUM(1)` instead of `COUNT(*)`. \n",
    "\n",
    "These two aggregate expressions do the same thing: they count the number of rows in a table. This is because when you use a scalar argument to an aggregate function, the the aggregate function aggregates that same value over all the rows. \n",
